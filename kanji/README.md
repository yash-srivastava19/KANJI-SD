## Kanji Data

This folder contains the Kanji Dataset that is basically the data that [Tagaini Jisho](https://github.com/Gnurou/tagainijisho/releases) uses.

## Dataset
Since there are issues with processing data of Github, we are going to host the data on Kaggle. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashsrivastava51213/kanji-png-dataset). The attribution will be given to the original authors, since I just published it for my own convinience.
